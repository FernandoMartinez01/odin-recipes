    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A smooth, velvety soup made with fresh pumpkin, carrots, onions, and a touch of garlic, blended with flavorful stock and seasoned with nutmeg. Comforting and perfect for chilly days. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stock</li>
        <li>Pumpkin (1kg)</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>1 Garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 Carrot</li>
        <li>Nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, melt a generous knob of butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté gently until they become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic, followed by the diced pumpkin and carrot. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the vegetables to develop some flavor.</li>
        <li>Pour in enough stock to completely cover the vegetables. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, use an immersion blender (or transfer to a regular blender in batches) to purée the soup until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg to taste. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
