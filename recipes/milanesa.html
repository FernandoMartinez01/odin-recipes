    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy breaded beef cutlets fried to golden perfection, paired with crunchy, golden French fries. A classic, satisfying meal loved for its comforting flavors and textures.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 thin beef cutlets (e.g. round or sirloin)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 cups breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Cutlets:
            Season the beef cutlets on both sides with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the milk. Add minced garlic and chopped parsley if desired for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Place the breadcrumbs in another shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Dip each beef cutlet into the egg mixture, ensuring it’s fully coated, then press it into the breadcrumbs, covering it evenly on both sides. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Fries:
            Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized sticks. Rinse under cold water, then pat dry thoroughly with a clean towel.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or fryer to 170-180°C (340-355°F). Fry the potatoes in batches until golden and crispy. Drain on paper towels and season with salt while still hot.</li>
        <li>In another skillet, heat enough oil to shallow-fry the milanesas. Cook the breaded cutlets for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Serve the milanesas hot alongside the freshly fried potatoes. Enjoy!</li>
