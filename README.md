# The Odin Project - First Challenge

## About This Project

This is my very first project from **The Odin Project**, where I’m learning the foundations of web development.

At this stage, I’m focusing on the basics of **HTML**, including:

- Creating a basic HTML document structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Adding images to a webpage
- Understanding semantic HTML elements
- Writing clean and readable code

This challenge helped me practice writing HTML code and get comfortable working with simple web pages. It’s an exciting first step on my journey into web development!

## What I Learned

- How to build a simple web page using HTML tags
- The importance of indentation and clean code for readability
- Basic file structure and how to link files and images
- Semantic elements and why they matter for accessibility and SEO

## Next Steps

I’m looking forward to learning:

- How to style my pages with CSS
- How to create more complex layouts
- The basics of JavaScript for interactivity

Thanks for checking out my work!
